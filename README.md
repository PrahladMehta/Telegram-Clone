# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Steps to setup project
- git clone https://github.com/PrahladMehta/Telegram-clone
- cd Telegram-clone
- npm install

- Live url:- https://dulcet-puppy-dadf49.netlify.app
- # The api is little bit confussing and i am not able to understand the schema or structure so i used dummy data to represent the chat between the user.
- # I am working on the light and dark mode.If it's completed, i will update both live and code.
